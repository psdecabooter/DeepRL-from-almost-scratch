# Deep RL Networks
In order to understand PyTorch and DeepRL on a deeper level, I decided to implement some algorithms from scratch using PyTorch.
These are my implementations of the common reinforcement learning algorithms DQN, A2C, and PPO using Pytorch and Gymnasium.
Feel free to use the code as a reference. My skill in pytorch increased by a lot with every algorithm, so the older the file, the more likely you are to find bad practices.
